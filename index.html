            <p>As tiny drops converge to form the sea, So do my small dreams coalesce to make a grander one. Like a pebble cast in a tranquil pond, A ripple forms and expands,</p>
            <p>Growing into a mighty wave, And so do I. Sailing towards the boundless ocean, I brave stormy seas In pursuit of my dreams.</p>
            <p>Guided by a tiny compass, I embark on a journey to the unknown. What destiny awaits me at its end? As tiny drops converge to form the sea, So do my small dreams coalesce to make a grander one.</p>
